# The code snippet below iterates through a dictionary, checks if any of the
# values are strings that can be converted to floats, and if so, converts them.
# It uses the str.isdigit() method to check if the string represents a digit, but this method alone is
# not sufficient to identify floats since it returns False for strings containing a decimal point. Therefore,
# we'll also try to convert each string to a float inside a try-except block to
#  catch any values that cannot be converted to floats. - courtesy of Ben
